Hi! This is a small instruction for the photo editor.

You can see the main filters on the main page: rotate the photo 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise,
a slider to change the visibility of the photo, filters to adjust brightness, sharpness and contrast, and a couple of black and white filters. There is a button at the bottom left of the page to save the resulting photo (nothing will
be saved unless you click it and select the desired path). There are also buttons to cancel actions (one or all).

All other filters are located on the second page. Three of them change the R, G and B parameters of the photo using sliders, the rest are "push-button". The name of the filter suggests what it is best used for.
For example, the "forest" filter will look good in nature photos, and the "coloring" filter will make kind of a page looks like a page from the coloring book out of the photo. Remember that the intensity of the filter depends on the number of clicks on the button.

That's it! Have fun editing photos :)
